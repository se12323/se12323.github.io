## Professional Background
I have a background in **Biology**, **Immunology**, and **Computer Science**. 
Currently, I am a **student** at **BCIT(British Columbia Institute of Technology)**.


### Experience
- **[2022 - 2022]**: BCIT ISEP project(COMP 4800) at Fortinet
- **[2019 - 2020]**: Researcher at IRCM (Institut de recherches cliniques de Montr√©al)
- **[2018 - 2018]**: Internship at SAIHST (Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences & Technology)


## Education
- **[2022 - 2024]** : B.Sc. - Applied Computer Science (Network Security Applications Development Option) at BCIT
- **[2020 - 2022]** : Diploma - Computer Systems (Data communications & Internetworking option) at BCIT
- **[2015 - 2019]** : B.Sc. - Biology at University of Ulsan


## Skills
- **Technical**: C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript
- **Soft Skills**: Teamwork, Adaptability, Work Ethic, Interpersonal Skills


## Projects
1. **[Advanced Packet Analysis Tool]** <br />
Currently, developing packet analysis tool integrated with Snort3, using Qt6 framework for GUI. <br />
<br />
2. **[DNS spoofing program]** [Link to project](https://github.com/HyungJoonLEE/COMP8505_assignment4) <br />
Creating RAW sockets to control data packets, modifies packet headers(Ethernet, ARP, DNS, IPv4),
and intercepts network traffic to manipulate DNS queries and responses for educational and ethical 
penetration testing purposes. <br />
<br />
3. **[Distributed System Brute Force Password Cracker using Salt]** [Link to project](https://github.com/HyungJoonLEE/COMP8005_project) <br />
Using OpenMP library, multi-threaded, with a server-client architecture, enabling parallel processing 
across several nodes. The server, or 'main' tower dispatches hashed value, salts, and thread number 
allocation to clients, which then utilize brute force techniques across MD5, Yescrypt, and SHA256 algorithms. <br />
<br />
4. **[Artificial Packet Dropper]** [Link to project](https://github.com/HyungJoonLEE/COMP7005_project) <br />
Sending and receiving data between three computers using multiplexing funcion(select), the program randomly 
drops packets according to the value entered by the user in the proxy. The program aims showing the operating 
principles of Seq and Ack. <br />
