## Introduction
Hello! My name is **Hyung**, the owner of this page. <br> 
I both majored in **Computer Science** and **Biology / Immunology** <br> 


## Skills
- **Technical**: C, C++, Python, Linux, Git
- **Soft Skills**: Teamwork, Adaptability, Work Ethic, Interpersonal Skills


### Experience
- **[2022 - 2022]**: ISEP project at Fortinet
- **[2019 - 2020]**: Researcher at IRCM 
- **[2018 - 2018]**: Internship at SAIHST 



## Projects
1. **[Advanced Packet Analysis Tool]** <br>
Currently, developing packet analysis tool integrated with Snort3, using C++14 and Qt6 framework for GUI. <br />
<br />
2. **[DNS spoofing program]** [Link to project](https://github.com/HyungJoonLEE/COMP8505_assignment4) <br>
Creating RAW sockets to control data packets, modifies packet headers(Ethernet, ARP, DNS, IPv4),
and intercepts network traffic to manipulate DNS queries and responses for educational and ethical 
penetration testing purposes. <br>
<br>
3. **[Distributed System Brute Force Password Cracker using Salt]** [Link to project](https://github.com/HyungJoonLEE/COMP8005_project) <br>
Using OpenMP library, multi-threaded, with a server-client architecture, enabling parallel processing 
across several nodes. The server, or 'main' tower dispatches hashed value, salts, and thread number 
allocation to clients, which then utilize brute force techniques across MD5, Yescrypt, and SHA256 algorithms. <br>
<br>
4. **[Artificial Packet Dropper]** [Link to project](https://github.com/HyungJoonLEE/COMP7005_project) <br>
Sending and receiving data between three computers using multiplexing funcion(select), the program randomly 
drops packets according to the value entered by the user in the proxy. The program aims showing the operating 
principles of Seq and Ack. <br>
