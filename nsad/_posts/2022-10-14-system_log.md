## System Log Checker (COMP7006_LAB 2)


## Log
A record of the operating state of a computer is called a log. In Linux, it is possible to record various events in log files or display them on the console using syslog.
> kernel log: <br/>
> kernel message. Created by a daemon called klogd. Currently, it seeps into rsyslog, which will be described below. <br/>
> system log: <br/>
> system log. Service logs generated by the syslogd daemon.<br/>


## rsyslog & syslog
> ### a) syslog
> syslog is a log collection memory system that records log information of kernels and programs. It is generally recorded as *date time, host, process: event*. syslog is a local It can record system log as well as program log information of remote host through tcp, udp protocol.
> ### b) rsyslog

> - As an upgraded version of syslog, rsyslog can simultaneously record local or remote logs in multiple lines and store log information in RDBMS such as MySQL, PGSQL, Oracle, etc. 
> - It has a powerful filter function that can filter all contents of the log.
> - rsyslog is the log system used on CentOS 6 and later systems, and has the following advantages over the older syslog log system:
>>   a) Multi-threaded support<br/>
>>   b) Protocol support such as TCP, SSL, TLS, RELP<br/>
>>   c) Powerful filter to filter any part of log information<br/>
>>   d) Support for custom output formats<br/>
>>   e) Ideal for enterprise-grade logging requirements<br/>
>>   f) modularity<br/>
>>   g) Record format in log<br/>
>>   h) Date Time Host Process [pid]: Event Content<br/>


## Concepts in rsyslog
An application on the system specifies a specific channel history log.
> p.s Channels set the logging level for logs by default. <br/>

When the program generates log information, it writes the log file to the specified local file, database, or remote rsyslog service through this channel.
Of course, the log output by the application program is also generally classified according to the stage. 
> For example, sshdconf defines a channel as log output at the authpriv, info level. # Logging - SyslogFacility AUTHPRIV - #LogLevel INFO


## Facility & Priority & Action
> ### Facility
> | Facility |              Funtion              |
> |----------|-----------------------------------|
> |   auth   | Messages generated by authenticator type occurred, such as login |
> | authprive| Messages generated by program types requiring personal authentication |
> |   cron   | Messages generated by automated scheduling programs (cron, at) |
> |  daemon  | Messages generated by daemons such as telneted and ftpd |
> |   kern   | Messages generated by kernel |
> |    lpr   | Messages generated by print type of program |
> |   mail   | Messages generated by mail system |
> |   mark   | Date types created by syslogd | 
> |   news   | Messages raised by the Usenet news program type | 
> |  syslog  | Messages encountered by the syslog program type
> |   user   | User process
> |   uucp   | Messages raised by the UUCP system
> |local 0~7 | Type left over for additional use
> 
> *â€» If you add .none after the facility, it means that the facility is excluded <br/>*
> ex) mail.none means that mail-related messages are excluded <br/>

> ### Priority
> | Priority | Description                                 |
> |----------|---------------------------------------------|
> |  debug   | Messages raised when debugging a program    |
> |   info   | Statistics, basic information message       |
> |  notice  | Messages that require special attention but   are not error| 
> |  warning | Warning messages that require attention     |
> |    err   | Message when an error occurs                |
> |   crit   | Messages that are not urgent, but at the stage where the system is experiencing problems
> |   alert  | Situations requiring immediate adjustment   |
> |   emerg  | A dangerous situation that should be communicated to all users |
> |   none   | Do not save messages under any circumstances|
> |     *    | Messages for anything that happens          |
> 
> - It indicates the level of risk and sends a message only when it is higher than the set level of risk.<br/>
> - If you use '=' in front of a level, it means that the level is the same as the level of risk.<br/>
> - Type of priority (listed from lowest to highest risk level)<br/>
> - \<Facility>.\<Priority>   ex) auth.alert

> ### Action
> | Type     | Description                                 |
> |----------|---------------------------------------------|
> |   file   | Add content to the file                     |
> |   @host  | Send a message to the specified host        |
> |   user   | Send a message to the specified user's screen |
> |    *     | Sends a message to the screen of all currently logged in users |
