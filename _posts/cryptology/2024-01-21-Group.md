## Group (G)
A group ***G***, denoted by { ***G***, **+** } such that **(a, b)** of elements in ***G*** an element **(a + b)** in ***G*** **×** ***G*** 
<br>    
**Following axioms are obeyed:**  
- <span style="color:red">**Closure under addition**</span>: If a and b belong to ***G***, then **a + b** is also in ***G***
- <span style="color:red">**Associative of addition**</span>: **a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c** for all **a**, **b**, **c** in ***G***
- <span style="color:red">**Identity element**</span>: There is an element e in ***G*** such that **a + e = e + a = a** for all **a** in ***G***
- <span style="color:red">**Inverse element**</span>: For each **a** in ***G***, there is an element **a′** in ***G*** such that **a + a′ = a′ + a = e**


### Abelian Group
The group in which the **commutative law** is established is called the ***Abelian group***   
- <span style="color:red">**Commutative of addition**</span>: **a + b = b + a** for all **a**, **b** in ***G***


#### Cyclic Group (Always Abelian)
The group is cyclic if every element of ***G*** is a power **a<sup>k</sup>** (**k** is an integer) 
of a fixed element **a ∈** ***G***
  

## Ring (R)
A ring ***R***, denoted by { ***R***, **+**, **×** }, such that for all **a**, **b**, **c** in ***R***   
Simply, a ring is a set of elements in which we can do addition, subtraction (Ex. a - b = a + (-b)), 
and multiplication        
<br>
**Following axioms are obeyed:**   
- <span style="color:red">**Closure under multiplication**</span>: If **a** and **b** belong to ***R***, then **ab** is also in ***R***   
- <span style="color:red">**Associativity of multiplication**</span>: **a(bc) = (ab)c** for all **a**, **b**, **c** in ***R***  
- <span style="color:red">**Distributive laws**</span>: **a(b + c) = ab + ac**, **(a + b)c = ac + bc** for all **a**, **b**, **c** in ***R*** 


### Commutative Ring
A Commutative Ring works in an integral domain   
<br>
**Following axioms are obeyed:**   
- <span style="color:red">**Commutativity of multiplication**</span>: **ab = ba** for all **a**, **b** in ***R***
- <span style="color:red">**Multiplicative identity**</span>: There is an element **1** in ***R*** such that **a×1 = 1×a = a** for all a in ***R***
- <span style="color:red">**No zero divisors**</span>: If **a**, **b** in ***R*** and **ab = 0**, then either **a = 0** or **b = 0**


## Field (F)
A field ***F***, denoted by { ***F***, **+** , **×** }, such that for all **a**, **b**, **c** in ***F***
Simply, a field is a set of elements in which we can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division without 
leaving the set   
**Division is defined with the following rule: a/b = a(b<sup>-1</sup>)**   
<br> 
**Following axioms are obeyed:**
- <span style="color:red">**Multiplicative inverse**</span>: For each **a** in ***F***, **except 0**, there is an element **a<sup>-1</sup>** in ***F*** such that **aa<sup>-1</sup> = (a<sup>-1</sup>)a = 1**


##  Finding Multiplicative Inverse
If ***n*** is prime, then all of the nonzero integers in ***Z<sub>n</sub>*** are relatively prime to ***n***   
**Ex)**
**n=11** (since 11 is a prime number): ***Z<sub>11</sub>*** **= { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }**   
>GCD of 1 and 11: GCD is 1<br>
>GCD of 2 and 11: GCD is 1<br>
>GCD of 3 and 11: GCD is 1<br>
>GCD of 4 and 11: GCD is 1<br>
>GCD of 5 and 11: GCD is 1<br>
>GCD of 6 and 11: GCD is 1<br>
>GCD of 7 and 11: GCD is 1<br>
>GCD of 8 and 11: GCD is 1<br>
>GCD of 9 and 11: GCD is 1<br>
>GCD of 10 and 11: GCD is 1<br>

➤ All of these **nonzero integers** in  ***Z<sub>11</sub>*** have a GCD of 1 with 11, which means they are all relatively prime to 11       
This illustrates the general principle that if ***n*** is a prime number, then every nonzero element of ***Z<sub>n</sub>*** will be relatively prime to ***n***   
<br>


To find the multiplicative inverses of all nonzero integers in ***Z<sub>n</sub>***, we need to find an integer **x** 
for each **nonzero integer** ***a*** in ***Z<sub>n</sub>*** such that ***a × x*** ≡ **1** (*mod* ***n***)
>The multiplicative inverse of 1 is 1 (since 1 × 1 ≡ 1 mod 11)<br>
>The multiplicative inverse of 2 is 6 (since 2 × 6 ≡ 1 mod 11)<br>
>The multiplicative inverse of 3 is 4 (since 3 × 4 ≡ 1 mod 11)<br>
>The multiplicative inverse of 4 is 3 (since 4 × 3 ≡ 1 mod 11)<br>
>The multiplicative inverse of 5 is 9 (since 5 × 9 ≡ 1 mod 11)<br>
>The multiplicative inverse of 6 is 2 (since 6 × 2 ≡ 1 mod 11)<br>
>The multiplicative inverse of 7 is 8 (since 7 × 8 ≡ 1 mod 11)<br>
>The multiplicative inverse of 8 is 7 (since 8 × 7 ≡ 1 mod 11)<br>
>The multiplicative inverse of 9 is 5 (since 9 × 5 ≡ 1 mod 11)<br>
>The multiplicative inverse of 10 is 10 (since 10 × 10 ≡ 1 mod 11)<br>
